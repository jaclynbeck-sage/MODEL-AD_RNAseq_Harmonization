# This script creates the folder structure in the MODEL-AD RNA Seq Harmonization
# Project on Synapse that Nextflow and the other scripts in this project rely
# on. Specifically, a folder for each study is added to the raw counts, bam
# files, and genotype validation folders, using the same name for the study as
# appears in annotations on Synapse.
#
# This script only needs to be run once, unless a completely new study is added
# to the data. In that case, existing folders will remain as-is and the new
# study's folders will be added to the existing structure.
#
# The locations of the main folders are read from the config.yml file.
